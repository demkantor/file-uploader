# File Uploader

> This is a full stack React-Express file uploader but could easily be modified to work with any back-end including cloud storage

> Follow the various paths to see how to do each variation of query and storage

> There is often many ways to get the same effect. see how the same outcome can come about from different methods laid out in this app including using class components vs function components, using redux and sagas and storing on server vs database

## Quick Start



```bash
#database
see included database.sql for setup and queries

# Install dependencies server/client
1. npm install
2. npm run server
3. npm run client (in a second terminal)
```

## some more info
```bash
#database
in server.js and pool.js you may find a username and password keeping you from getting this functioning.
i use these to connect to postgres locally but likely you dont, so remove them.
if you do, change to yours
